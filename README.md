# ANTLRMathExpr
This is code I'm using as a sandbox to solve problems I encounter while writing a much more sophisticated parser. This parser is a very simplified model that parses simple mathematical expressions. It is not meant to be useful to anyone and should not be used by students looking for good examples.
